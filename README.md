# Using Deep Reinforcement Learning to SimulateBionic Arm Control

This is a small research aimed at testing the reinforcement learning capabilitiesfor autonomous control of the bionic arm.  The main goal in the future is toachieve full autonomy in the control of the bionic arm, so that it adapts to anytask in the environment.

To implementreinforcement learning, the Gym library from OpenAI was chosen.  

It worked inconjunction with Unity ML Agents via Python.A model of a hand with 15 degrees of freedom was built.  The game consistedin grabbing an item that appeared in one of 3 different positions at random.
