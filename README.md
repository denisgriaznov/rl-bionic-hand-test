# Using Deep Reinforcement Learning to SimulateBionic Arm Control

This is a small research aimed at testing the reinforcement learning capabilitiesfor autonomous control of the bionic arm.  The main goal in the future is toachieve full autonomy in the control of the bionic arm, so that it adapts to anytask in the environment.
